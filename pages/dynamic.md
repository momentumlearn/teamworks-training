Dynamic programming language

*Dynamic programming language* in computer science is a class of high-level programming languages, which at runtime, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation. These behaviors could include an extension of the program, by adding new code, by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system. Although similar behaviors can be emulated in nearly any language, with varying degrees of difficulty, complexity and performance costs, dynamic languages provide direct tools to make use of them. Many of these features were first implemented as native features in the Lisp programming language. 

## Examples

Popular dynamic programming languages include [[JavaScript]], [[Python]], Ruby, PHP, Lua and Perl.
